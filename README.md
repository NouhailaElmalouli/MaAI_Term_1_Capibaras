As the global population of visually impaired individuals is projected to reach 18.5% by 2050, the need for truly inclusive architectural spaces has never been more urgent. That’s why, as part of the specialized Master in AI for Architecture & the Built Environment at Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, my team and I embarked on a mission to bridge this gap with innovation and empathy.
I proudly present the Building Analysis Tool (B.A.T)—a revolutionary platform designed to empower architects to create spaces that are not just functional but deeply human-centered. Focused on primary healthcare centers, B.A.T seamlessly integrates into the architectural workflow to enhance navigation, safety, and inclusivity for visually impaired users.

What makes B.A.T groundbreaking is its advanced AI technologies used in the technical workflow:
1. IFC Import: Architects upload the building's IFC file, which contains its geometry and metadata.
2. Data Filtering: The system refines the IFC data to retain relevant components (walls, doors, pathways).
3. Graph Creation: Converts the filtered data into a graph structure, analyzing connections and calculating distances.
4. Walkability Analysis: Applies a custom formula to identify accessible, safe, and efficient paths for visually impaired users.
5. Image Segmentation: Detects architectural elements and obstacles through 3D visualization and AI-based segmentation.
6. Guideline Integration: Incorporates accessibility standards (ADA, iHFG, FGI) to offer evidence-based recommendations.
7. AI Suggestions: Uses LLMs to provide actionable design improvements for better navigation and inclusivity.
8. Output: Generates accessibility reports, optimized paths, and actionable design feedback.

This project represents more than just technological innovation; it’s a step toward reshaping how we design for inclusivity, accessibility, and dignity.

Together, we’re proving that architecture and AI can work hand in hand to create spaces that truly serve everyone. 

# Features: 

1.Graph-based spatial analysis: Spot potential navigation bottlenecks, identify wayfinding improvements.

2.Image segmentation of interiors: Highlight key elements (doors, ramps, tactile surfaces).'

3.RAG: Recommend accessible design strategies tailored to visually-impaired users.

Importance values excel: We included an Excel sheet that ranks different spaces within a healthcare facility based on their importance for visually impaired users. Each space was evaluated using a priority score from 1 to 10, where:

10 = most critical for independent and safe navigation

1 = least critical or non-essential for direct user access

This hierarchy was developed to guide our design and analysis tool in emphasizing high-priority zones like entrances, reception areas, restrooms, and examination rooms. Lower-priority zones (e.g., staff-only areas or storage) were treated with less accessibility emphasis in automated recommendations.
